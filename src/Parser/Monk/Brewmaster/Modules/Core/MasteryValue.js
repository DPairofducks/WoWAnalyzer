/**
 * This class represents the Markov Chain with which the Mastery stacks
 * are modeled. The transition probabilities are defined by two
 * potential operations:
 *
 * 1. Guaranteed Addition: from using an ability that generates a stack
 * 100% of the time (e.g. BoS, BoF). The probability of having i stacks
 * afterward is equal to the probability of having i-1 stacks before
 * (the probability of having 0 stacks afterward is 0).
 *
 * 2. Attack: The probability of having i > 0 stacks afterward is equal to
 * the probability of being hit with i - 1 stacks. The probability of
 * having 0 stacks afterward is the sum of the probabilities of dodging
 * with each number of stacks. Note that there is a natural cap on the
 * number of stacks you can reach, since after that point every hit will
 * be a dodge.
 *
 * The expected number of stacks you have is just the sum of the indices
 * weighted by the values.

/**
 * Estimate the expected value of mastery on this fight. The *actual*
 * estimated value is subject to greater variance.
 * On the other hand, the expected value averages over all
 * possible outcomes and gives a better sense of how valuable mastery is
 * if you were to do this fight again. This values more stable over
 * repeated attempts or kills and reflects the value of mastery (and the
 * execution of the rotation) more closely than how well-favored you
 * were on this particular attempt.
 *
 * We calculate the expected value by applying the Markov Chain above to
 * the timeline to calculate the expected number of stacks at each
 * dodgeable event. This is then combined with information about the
 * expected damage of each dodged hit (dodge events have amount: 0,
 * absorbed: 0, etc.) to provide a best-guess estimate of the damage
 * you'll mitigate on average. The actual estimate (shown in the
 * tooltip) may be over or under this, but is unlikely to be far from
 * it.
 *
 * This madness was authored by emallson. If you need further explanation of
 * the theory behind it, find me on discord.
